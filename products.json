The ingredients are slowly infused with the tallow and beeswax to produce a yummy finished product!</p><p>They will not fill the room quite like a store-bought candles will, but they have a warm scent and are totally non-toxic.</p><p><strong><em>SCENT PROFILE - </em></strong>This candle has a gentle nutmeg and spice aroma that reminds me of baked goods on an autumn day. It is warm and cozy. </p><p><strong><em>CANDLE CARE -</em></strong> For best results, allow the candle to burn to the edge each time it burns. This can take up to 4 hours. This ensures that the candle will burn evenly and won’t create a “tunnel” of beeswax.</p><p>Trim the wick before each burn. You can trim the wick by pinching off the charred part with your fingers. This ensures your wick won’t burn too fast.</p><p></p><p>The candle comes in an 8-ounce amber glass jar with a lid.</p>"

It can be used for those who make lists, have a hard time saying no, are strong in words and action, and have trouble sitting still. Blue vervain can help those who have nervous or tension headaches, irritability, muscular tension, inflammation, and insomnia. Blue vervain can also be used for those with anger fits, muscle spasms, PMS symptoms, digestive issues, and tension help specifically in the neck and shoulders. If you hold tension in your neck and shoulders, as I do, then blue vervain is the herb for you!</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\">Blue vervain can be taken before meals to help with digestion.

In ancient times, catnip was praised for its ability to help chest congestion, loosen phlegm, ease colicky babies, relieve gassiness, help relieve diarrhea, especially in children, and much more.

Her method utilizes alcohol, heat, and water to extract all the beneficial constituents from cordyceps. A mushroom supplement should be heated to release all the beneficial polysaccharides.</p><p style=\"text-align:start;white-space:pre-wrap;\" class=\"\">This elixir contains alcohol, Mount Shasta spring water, raw honey, and non-GMO, food-grade, palm-derived glycerin. The honey adds a touch of sweetness and medicinal qualities, and the small amount of glycerin helps to suspend cordyceps so each dose is balanced. The alcohol is necessary for one of the extraction parts, but in the final dose, it is a balanced amount of alcohol, water, honey, and glycerin.</p><p style=\"text-align:start;white-space:pre-wrap;\" class=\"\">ABOUT</p><p style=\"text-align:start;white-space:pre-wrap;\" class=\"\">Arguably the superfood of all mushrooms, cordyceps are packed with immune-supporting and power-packed constituents. Cordyceps contain high amounts of beta-glucans and polysaccharides. Dr. Richard Allen Miller says, “Polysaccharides are long sugar chains with many oxygen sections within them. As these sugars are broken down by the body, the oxygen molecules are released and absorbed on a cellular level….This mushroom is extremely high in oxygen molecules.”</p><p style=\"text-align:start;white-space:pre-wrap;\" class=\"\">Here are a few of the ways that cordyceps can support the body:</p><p style=\"text-align:start;white-space:pre-wrap;\" class=\"\">ANTIBIOTICS — Within the mushroom, it contains an antibiotic called “Cordyceptin.” This antibiotic is extremely effective against bacteria that are otherwise antibiotic-resistant. Cordyceps has been shown in studies to act as an antibiotic while still maintaining the health of the body.</p><p style=\"text-align:start;white-space:pre-wrap;\" class=\"\">RESPIRATORY — Since cordyceps helps to provide oxygen to the body, it can also support respiratory health. Those with asthma, bronchitis infections, tuberculosis, and coughs can be supported with cordyceps.</p><p style=\"text-align:start;white-space:pre-wrap;\" class=\"\">HORMONES — In studies, cordyceps increased healthy hormone levels and supported the endocrine system.</p><p style=\"text-align:start;white-space:pre-wrap;\" class=\"\">ATHLETIC STAMINA — Cordyceps can increase physical stamina and has been shown to do that in several studies! In 1993, a group of 9 women were taking cordyceps and then shattered 9 world records, by a LOT. The Olympic committee finally ruled that cordyceps were allowed to be taken by all athletes.</p><p style=\"text-align:start;white-space:pre-wrap;\" class=\"\">CHOLESTEROL — Studies have shown that cordyceps can help the body maintain a healthy level of cholesterol. Studies showed that cordyceps lowered total cholesterol by 10-21%, and triglycerides by 9 to 26%. It simultaneously increased HDL by 27-30% (the good cholesterol!)</p><p style=\"text-align:start;white-space:pre-wrap;\" class=\"\">LIVER — Cordyceps can help improve liver conditions such as hepatitis.</p><p style=\"text-align:start;white-space:pre-wrap;\" class=\"\">HEART HEALTH — Cordyceps has been shown to calm irregular heartbeats. Cordyceps were administered to mice and showed that mice had a 400% increase in their survival rate.</p><p style=\"text-align:start;white-space:pre-wrap;\" class=\"\">TUMORS — Studies were conducted in China and Japan using a dose of 6 grams per day. Dr. Richard Allen Miller says, “In conjunction with chemotherapy, tumors reduced in size in 46% of patients….White blood cell counts were maintained and tumor size was significantly reduced in about half of the patients.”</p><p style=\"text-align:start;white-space:pre-wrap;\" class=\"\">IMMUNE — It can increase muscle mass and increase the building of healthy cells. It can help to recharge the body’s ability to fight infections and tumors.</p><p style=\"text-align:start;white-space:pre-wrap;\" class=\"\">FATIGUE — A dose of 3 grams of cordyceps a day was shown to dramatically reduce fatigue in elderly patients. It also helps to increase cellular production and oxygen supply in the body.</p><p style=\"text-align:start;white-space:pre-wrap;\" class=\"\">REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH — It has been shown to improve libido in both men and women and help to come against fertility and the struggles that come along with that. Infertile sperm count improved by 300% after taking cordyceps.</p><p style=\"text-align:start;white-space:pre-wrap;\" class=\"\">And I could seriously go on and on about cordyceps! What CAN’T it do, truly.</p><p class=\"\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Major credit goes to Dr. Richard Allen Miller for his compilation of the amazing benefits of forceps, found in his book “Power Tools for the 21st Century” found <a href=\"https://www.richardalanmiller.com/bookstore/p/power-tools-for-the-21st-century\">here</a> on his website. </p>"

This salve is smooth yet slightly sticky. Apply to bug bites, splinters, and more, and cover with a bandage. Leave the salve on for a few hours or up to 12 hours, then gently remove it with a wet washcloth. Avoid getting on clothing as this salve can stain due to the charcoal. With activated charcoal and bentonite clay working together, this drawing salve is incredible for lifting things out of your skin. Think poison from bug bites, splinters, rashes, infections, and ingrown toenails. It can also be used as a spot treatment on the face for acne. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\"></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\">ABOUT THE INGREDIENTS:</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\"><strong>Comfrey (<em>symphytum officinalis</em>)</strong> is a medicinal herb that can often be found growing wild. It is most known for its ability to promote healing after sprains and fractures. Comfrey can be used externally to soothe inflamed joints or injuries. It is best to avoid applying comfrey to wounds that are deep, like puncture wounds, as it can close the wound too quickly without letting the body rid itself of possible infection. When used in this salve, comfrey acts as an anti-inflammatory agent to calm areas that have been stung, bitten, or have a rash.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\"><strong>Echinacea root</strong> (<strong><em><span>E.</span>angustifolia) </em></strong>was traditionally used by Native Americans to treat snakebites and infections. It can act like an herbal antibiotic and help to prevent infections.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\"><strong>Plantain (<em>plantago major</em>)</strong> is known for its soothing properties and ability to help draw impurities and foreign objects out of the skin. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\"><strong>Activated charcoal</strong> is a powerful ingredient that binds to things like poison and pulls it out of your system. It can be taken internally to remedy food poisoning or used externally, like in this salve.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\"><strong>Bentonite clay</strong> is known for its ability to pull toxins like heavy metals from substances. While it can commonly be found as an ingredient in face masks, when used in a salve, it dries and tightens, binding to and pulling out foreign objects like a bee sting or splinter.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\"></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\">Ingredients — Organic cold-pressed jojoba oil, all wildcrafted comfrey leaf, echinacea root, and plantain leaf, bentonite clay, activated charcoal, beeswax</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\"></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\">Comes in a 1-ounce amber glass jar OR a lip balm tube for easy, on-the-go application. </p>"

It can be called, ‘Nature’s Antibiotic’ and reached for whenever an antibiotic would normally be needed.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\">It can activate the immune system, so it is best taken at the first sign of sickness, helping the body to rid itself of infections. It can stimulate an immune response and can raise white blood counts. If taken in the middle of sickness, the body might become extra tired because it has already been working hard to combat whatever virus your body has. It can be especially helpful for upper respiratory tract infections.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\">This tincture was crafted with fresh roots.

    "description": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\">ABOUT:</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\">Goldenrod is often blamed for seasonal allergies when in reality, its bright yellow blooms can help to counteract seasonal allergies and even animal allergies. It can help thin the mucus and stimulate the body to bring it up and out. After taking a dose of goldenrod, you might notice the urge to sneeze or cough or use the restroom, as it signals to your body to start cleansing where it needs it the most.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\">It is well-known for its ability to cleanse the urinary tract and also help the body pass kidney stones. As a diuretic, it increases the frequency of urine, cleansing the body as it flushes out the urinary tract. As a kidney tonic, it can help cleanse the blood through the kidneys.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\">Goldenrod can be used to help digestive issues such as gas, stomach pains, and diarrhea. Its bitter taste can help stimulate the flow of bile, preparing the body to digest food when taken half an hour before a meal.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\">Goldenrod can be taken for respiratory issues, bronchitis, sinus infections, and colds. It can help the body push stuck mucus up and out of the body. When gargled, it can also help relieve inflammation in the throat. It is incredible at cleansing the body of the remnants of sickness when also taken after the illness has passed.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\">It has a strong, slightly bitter flavor that is reminiscent of anise or resin.&nbsp;<br><br>CONTRAINDICATIONS:&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\">For those with kidney problems, be sure to keep your hydration high as the goldenrod flushes fluids from your system.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\">ACTIONS:&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\">Anti-inflammatory</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\">Antispasmodic</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\">Bitter</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\">Astringent</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\">Diuretic</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\">Diaphoretic<br><br>DOSAGE:&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\">You can try 1-3ml, 2-3 times a day or as needed.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\"></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\"><strong><em>A NOTE ABOUT OUR STANDARDS —</em></strong> All of our tinctures and elixirs (except for the mushroom elixirs) are made with 100-proof alcohol (grain alcohol and local spring water) and fresh plant material.

    "description": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\"><span>This is a nourishing oil formulated to offer scalp and hair support, promote shiny hair, and promote hair growth.</span></p><p class=\"\" style=\"text-align: start; ; white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\"><strong>ROSEMARY</strong> — This herb has been used for centuries and is a special part of many belief systems. It was used in Greece by students who braided it into their hair to help them study. During the Renaissance period, rosemary was used by herbalists for their patients and it was also used by the French for many ailments. It was also considered to be a symbol of Christ, as it was supposed to only grow to the age of 33 years and never grow taller, only wider.  It boasts anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits. Rosemary can help to stimulate hair growth by improving circulation to the scalp. It has been shown in many studies to encourage hair growth in people of all ages. It is also a gentle support for headaches, helping to relieve tension.  It can promote scalp health along with its other benefits!   </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\"><strong>PEPPERMINT</strong> — This herb is well-known for its strong and fresh scent. Peppermint is an invasive plant that can help with a wide variety of ailments when taken internally, and when used externally it can help to relieve rashes, provide a cooling effect, and help to soothe itchy skin. It can help to revitalize the scalp and promote healthy skin, which is important for hair growth. In one study it has been shown to increase dermal thickness, follicle number, and follicle depth when applied topically on the scalp. That study (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4289931/)\"><u><span>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4289931/)</span></u></a> used peppermint essential oil which is a strong, highly isolated portion of the plant. In this hair oil, whole peppermint is utilized which yields a more potent, balanced version of the plant.     </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\"><strong>NETTLE LEAF</strong> — This stinging plant is rich in vitamins and minerals. Like peppermint and rosemary, stinging nettles can help to boost circulation when applied topically. Nettles contain antioxidants which can help encourage hair growth. It is an astringent that can help to gently cleanse the scalp and contains acids and fatty acids that can nourish the hair follicles and promote shiny hair. Nettle can also help to promote a healthy scalp. The vitamins and minerals found in nettles can help to coat the hair strands and promote healthy, shiny hair.  </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\"><strong>CALENDULA</strong> — A beautiful orange flower in the sunflower family, calendula is a powerful herb for skin support when used topically.  Calendula can help to quickly heal wounds, soothe skin with its anti-inflammatory properties, and can help to promote a healthy scalp which is important for hair growth.  Calendula can help promote follicle growth and can protect the hair strands as they grow.   </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\"><span>Together, these plants and flowers work to gently stimulate the scalp, encourage circulation, and promote hair growth.

An actual preservative is needed if it will be stored at room temperature. Preservatives are NOT vitamin E or rosemary oil, as those do not inhibit bacterial growth. When working with water and oil, we wanted to avoid any reactions that occur when bacteria are introduced to the jar. This naturally happens each time the butter is scooped out with bare hands! We chose to use a clean, safe preservative because the benefits greatly outweigh the risks of bacterial contamination. We still recommend using clean hands to scoop out the magnesium butter, but you can rest easy knowing that no other bacteria will be introduced and grow in the butter!</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\"><em>comes in a 4-ounce amber glass jar</em></p>"

It is useful for removing mucus that needs to be expelled from the lungs. The resin from the needles can also help to heal the tissue after excessive amounts of coughing.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\">When used externally, it can be a warming circulatory stimulant for cold, winter nights. It can be massaged into the skin in areas that need warmth or lymphatic support. It can also be used to clean wounds and help prevent infections.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\">As emotional support, white pine can be taken to help open the lungs which can become smaller in times of grief.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\"></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\"><strong>CONTRAINDICATIONS:</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\">None known.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\"></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\"><strong>ACTIONS:</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\">Expectorant</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\">Astringent</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\">Circulatory stimulant</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\">Mild diuretic</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\">Mild antiviral&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\">Immune stimulant</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\">Grief support</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\"></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\"><strong><em>A NOTE ABOUT OUR STANDARDS —</em></strong> All of our tinctures and elixirs (except for the mushroom elixirs) are made with 100-proof alcohol (grain alcohol and local spring water) and fresh plant material. For elixirs, they are made with 100-proof alcohol, raw honey, and fresh plant material.</p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\">We source fresh plants from California, from farmers who practice organic farming or “beyond organic” farming practices. All herbs are made into extracts within 24 hours of being picked, so they are extra potent!</p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\">We use fresh plants to preserve both water- and alcohol-soluble constituents that are lost when the plant is dried. Fresh plants make for a more potent extract and preserve the life force of the plant in the season it was meant to produce in.</p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\"><em>Tincture = alcohol + herb</em></p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\"><em>Elixir = alcohol + raw honey + herb</em></p>"
