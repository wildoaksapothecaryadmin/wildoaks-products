The herbs, roots, and mushrooms have all been traditionally used to support the airways of the body. The moistening actions of some of the herbs help the body through dry, aching coughs. This blend may support those with asthma or bronchitis, deep, barking coughs, old coughs that seem to linger, lung spasms, aching lungs, and mucus that cannot seem to work its way up and out of the body. This blend may also support gentle energy levels after bouts with fatigue, and may help to cool the body when working through hot sicknesses.</span></p><p class=\"cvGsUA direction-ltr align-justify para-style-body\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\"><span>This blend was inspired by the work of RJ Whelan and his herbal suggestions for lung support. </span></p><p class=\"cvGsUA direction-ltr align-justify para-style-body\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\">Ingredients — <span>Wildcrafted fresh extracts of elecampane root (inula helenium), elderflower (sambucus nigra), mullein leaf (verbascum thapsus), marshmallow root (althaea officinalis), cordyceps fruiting body (cordyceps militaris),* grain alcohol, spring water, non-GMO palm-derived glycerin, raw honey *heated for full benefits</span></p><p class=\"cvGsUA direction-ltr align-justify para-style-body\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\" data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\"><em>comes in a 2-ounce amber glass dropper bottle</em></p>"
